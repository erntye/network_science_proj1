#TODO

1. get all xml -> author_class/csv -> conference graph

2. gui for config -> connect to input and output

3. author from main xml -> institute -> reputation + geo lat lng

4. do the questions

• What network science measure reflects the prestige of venues/authors? 
- different centrality measures & see how it compares to arbitrary Tier list
• How prestige of institutes and authors who publish in premium venues are correlated?
Q2A - prestige of institute plot against number of unique authors in Tier 1 venues
Q2B - prestige of institute vs number of publications in Tier 1 venues
• What is the impact of network effect on the reputation and success of data scientists? We assume that a data scientist is successful if he/she can publish in
premium venues (Tier 1) consistently. A successful data scientist has high
reputation.
- SKIP
• How the location of institution a scientist belongs to plays a role in success?
- average distance from institute to top 10
• How likely an author can move from non-premium venues to premium venues in his/her career? How about the reverse scenario?
- same as below
• How will the career of data scientists be? Does initial reputation of publication venues predict success?
- first and last 5 reputation and do a sankey

Network
Nodes: Conferences
Edges: number of people who publish in conference A then B within 5 Publications
- how to measure scientist success? -> normalise prestige scores from network to have mean 0, success of scientist = summation of entire career’s scores
